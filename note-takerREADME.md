# note-taker
#### Author: tylerroth15

The assignment was to create a note take that as a user, I will be able to write and save notes as well as having the ability to delete notes that have been written before. This will allow me, as the user, to organize thoughts and keep track of tasks that I need to complete.

In the screenshot below you will see the note taker when it is actively being added to. Please note the save and edit icon on the upper right hand corner.
